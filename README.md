# C++
- Project No. 1 - Double the number
- BRIEF - Create a program/function that asks the user to enter an integer, waits for the input, then tells them what 2 times that number is.
• The output should be something like this: Enter an integer: 56
Double that number is: 112
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #ask the user to enter an integer
              #takes the interger in using a variable
              #uses the number saved in the variable
              #outputs the string and then takes the stored variable and times it by 2
              #returns the statement if it is working properly
- CHALLENGES FACED - As this was the first time using C++, it took a while to get used to the new language.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I read over our session notes quite a lot so that I got to grips with how things were meant to be written and the new syntax.

- Project No. 2 - Total of 3 numbers
- BRIEF - Create a function and within it write your statements so that it takes in three numbers and outputs the total of the three numbers; For example – a user inputs 3, 5 & 8. The output will be 16.
Your function should work so that a user can input any three numbers they wish.
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #type of value returned by function, followed by variables 
              #taking in the input of the three numbers
              #adding the three numbers together
              #displaying the total of the three numbers
- CHALLENGES FACED - I was still fairly new to C++ but I was fairly confident of this exercise.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I just made sure I read through all the sessions note to clarify any issues that I might face.
