# C++
- Project No. 1 - Double the number
- BRIEF - Create a program/function that asks the user to enter an integer, waits for the input, then tells them what 2 times that number is.
â€¢ The output should be something like this: Enter an integer: 56
Double that number is: 112
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #ask the user to enter an integer
              #takes the interger in using a variable
              #uses the number saved in the variable
              #outputs the string and then takes the stored variable and times it by 2
              #returns the statement if it is working properly
- CHALLENGES FACED - As this was the first time using C++, it took a while to get used to the new language.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I read over our session notes quite a lot so that I got to grips with how things were meant to be written and the new syntax.
