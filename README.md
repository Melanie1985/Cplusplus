# C++
- Project No. 1 - Double the number
- BRIEF - Create a program/function that asks the user to enter an integer, waits for the input, then tells them what 2 times that number is.
• The output should be something like this: Enter an integer: 56
Double that number is: 112
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #ask the user to enter an integer
              #takes the interger in using a variable
              #uses the number saved in the variable
              #outputs the string and then takes the stored variable and times it by 2
              #returns the statement if it is working properly
- CHALLENGES FACED - As this was the first time using C++, it took a while to get used to the new language.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I read over our session notes quite a lot so that I got to grips with how things were meant to be written and the new syntax.

- Project No. 2 - Total of 3 numbers
- BRIEF - Create a function and within it write your statements so that it takes in three numbers and outputs the total of the three numbers; For example – a user inputs 3, 5 & 8. The output will be 16.
Your function should work so that a user can input any three numbers they wish.
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #type of value returned by function, followed by variables 
              #taking in the input of the three numbers
              #adding the three numbers together
              #displaying the total of the three numbers
- CHALLENGES FACED - I was still fairly new to C++ but I was fairly confident of this exercise.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I just made sure I read through all the sessions note to clarify any issues that I might face.

- Project No. 3 - Get value from user
- BRIEF - Look at the code given. Create a main function that takes the value getValueFromUser(). As an example the final output should look like this: 4 + 3 = 7. You can only make changes to the main() function. No further changes to getValueFromUser() are allowed. Only input from a user is allowed, you can’t assign values to variables.
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #function to ask a user to input a number and then return the input
              #looks for this first and runs the code above
              #looks for this next and runs code 
              #assigned a variable sum to add the two variables above together
              #outputs the first input, then the second and then the sum
- CHALLENGES FACED - I struggled on this one to try and figure out how I could add 2 integers together without changing any of the getValueFromUser function.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I went back over my notes and also looked online at a few different C++ sites to look for any help. I was finally able to complete my code and understand that I needed to create variable for each function.


- Project No. 4 - Competition
- BRIEF - You’re working for a company that specialises in competition winners. They want you to create a function for the three finalists. The n range is between 0-1000. The winner scores between 900-1000 points. Second place scores between 800-900 points. Third place scores between 700-800 points. Anything under 700 does not go through. They want the competition representative to be able to input the three separate scores: Alice scored 978, Bill scored 841, Rachael scored 789
The output for this function should be:
“Alice is the winner with a score of 978.
Bill is second place with a score of 841.
And Rachael is third place with a score of 789. Well done to all of our finalists.”  
Make sure to include a statement for any errors in the input (if it is below 700).
 - USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #Create a function
              #create variables and define them as integers
              #create variables and define them as strings
              #create a variable for the counter
              #get user input
              #takes in winning score and their name
              #if statements with the score ranges
              #outputs the winners name and the score
              #counts through each statement
              #else statement which outputs message if points scored aren't within the range 
              #if statement which asks if the counter is equal to 3
              #outputs final statement if all 3 statements above are true
              #main function
- CHALLENGES FACED - This was the most code I had ever written for a program so far as there were many different things to take into account. I needed variables for intergers and strings, lots of output statements and input. Then else and if statements.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I tried to condense it down as much as I could so that my code was clean and simple.

- Project No. 5 - Odd sum
- BRIEF - Create a function that takes in numbers between 0-30 and outputs the total sum of the odd numbers only. 
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #declaring and initialising my variable oddSum
              #for loop used to iterate 1 onto number inputted
              #if statement which sees if the number inputted is an odd number (not divisible by 2) 
              #incrementoddSum by 1
              #terminal shows the sum of the odd numbers
- CHALLENGES FACED - I had worked with for loops before so was used to how that worked but I had to figure out how to get just the odd numbers to add together.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I figured out that I would need an if statement with a formula to see if a number is able to be divided by 2. If it isn't then that would mean its an odd number. Once I figured this out, the rest was easy.

- Project No. 6 - Even x 3
- BRIEF - Create a function that takes in numbers between 0-30 and outputs each even number multiplied by 3. 
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #for loop to loop through numbers 0 - 30
              #if statement that states if i is divisible by 2 then its an even number  
              #prints to the terminal each even number * 3
              #calls the function
- CHALLENGES FACED - Once again I found it a little difficult to see how I could output even numbers multiplied by three but I thought I would use the same method as the previous project.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I did the opposite of the odd number challenge so used an if statement to see if the number was divisible by 2 then its even. I then just multiplied that number by 3.

- Project No. 7 - Counter
- BRIEF - Create a function that while the counter is less than 10, the output to the terminal will be:
“The number is n”
When the counter reaches 5 the output will be: “We are halfway through”
When the counter reaches 10 the output will be: “This is the end of the program”
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #declare variable called count
              #while loop that states if count is less than 10 print out statement
              #if statement that states when count is equal to 5 then print statement to terminal
              #counter to iterate through
              #statement to say its the end of the program once counter reaches 10
- CHALLENGES FACED - With this exercise I didn't know how I would be able to get the terminal to output a message inbetween numbers.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - It was all about the where I put the curly brackets with this one. After I got this far, the rest of the code came naturally.

- Project No. 8 - Structs
- BRIEF - Create a struct for a company with individual employee details:
Once you’ve created the struct write a function that prints to the console who works in what department. The output should be:
“Employee number: <employee number>”
“<person> works in the <department> department”
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #created four variables to hold in information about a person.
              #used the list I was given to create my employee and and department list
              #used whoAndWhere function 
              #output each individuals employee details
- CHALLENGES FACED - I enjoyed this exercise as it was completely new and there were lots to read over to make sure my code worked.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I read through the notes so that I didn't get any of my syntax wrong and this helped me.

- Project No. 9 - Flowers array
- BRIEF - Print the following array to the terminal using a loop: string flowers[]{"Daisies", "Gardenias", "Lilies", "Orchids",
"Roses", "Sunflowers", "Tulips", "Dahlias", "Peonies"};
Output should be: Daisies, Gardenias, Lilies, Orchids, Roses, Sunflowers, Tulips, Dahlias, Peonies.
Please include commas
- USING C++ IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #create a variable and array along with its elements
              #for loop to iterate through each element
              #prints out list of flowers using the index
- CHALLENGES FACED - This was another piece of code that I enjoyed writing as I felt I completely understood it.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - Finding the names of flowers!!

- Project No. 10 - Login File
- BRIEF - In this home learning task you’re going to create a file, that contains a username and password. It then checks the username and password you supplied to log into the file. I had all the different steps given to me.
